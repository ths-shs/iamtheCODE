                                To measure the program's success at Taal High School, the primary metrics should focus
                                on
                                quantitative skill attainment and qualitative student empowerment. Success is measured
                                by
                                tracking
                                the completion rate of the 12-week coding curriculum and the number of free courses
                                completed per
                                student. The qualitative success is measured through feedback surveys assessing their
                                confidence in
                                digital skills and problem-solving.
